# Discord Timed Out Information & Appeal Guide

This page provides detailed information about Discord timeouts, including how they work, reasons, and how to appeal if possible.

## What Is a Timeout?
A timeout is a temporary restriction placed on a user by server moderators or automated moderation tools. During a timeout, the user cannot send messages, react to messages, or perform certain actions for the duration of the timeout.

## When Do Timeouts Occur?
Timeouts are issued for rule violations such as:
- Spamming or flooding channels
- Using offensive language or content
- Repeated violations of server rules
- Automated moderation triggers

## Timeout Duration
Timeouts can last from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the severity of the violation and the moderation decision.

## How to Know You Are Timed Out
- You will see a notification stating you are "timed out" when attempting to send messages.
- The message input box may be disabled.
- You may be unable to react, join voice channels, or perform certain actions.

## Can You Appeal a Timeout?
- **Automatic timeouts** usually end automatically after the specified period, no appeal needed.
- **Moderated timeouts** can sometimes be appealed if you believe it was a mistake or if you want to explain your situation.

## How to Appeal a Timeout
1. Contact a server moderator or admin politely.
2. Provide context and reasons why the timeout should be reconsidered.
3. Use the following link to submit your appeal:  
[Appeal Your Timeout Here](https://tally.so/r/MeepJl)  
4. Wait for their response—appeals are handled at the moderator's discretion.

## Important Notes
- Not all server timeouts are eligible for appeal; it depends on the severity and server policies.
- Respect the moderation decision to maintain a positive community environment.
- Review server rules to prevent future timeouts.
